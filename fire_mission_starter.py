Fire Mission Starter Script

This script runs on boot, monitors a GPIO switch, and starts the firefighting
mission when the switch is triggered. It also provides LED feedback.
The script launches navigation components but does not send navigation goals,
allowing the existing teensy_bridge fire detection system to handle goal publishing.
